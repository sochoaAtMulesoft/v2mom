## Vision

*Prompt*:  What do you want to achieve

## Values

*Prompt*: What principles and beliefs are important to you?

### Trust

I will strive to earn my teammates' trust by providing honest and considerate feedback, 
driving our project initiatives to done by doing any and all that needs to be done, and 
striving for a high level of quality in the solutions we engineer for our customers.  

### Customer Success

It is important that we design solutions that both meet the short term goals and that 
help our team to be sustainable in the long term.  That means having a bias for 
automation and customer self-service in ways that meet or exceed industry stands.  

In addition to building the right tools and services for Mulesoft core platform to be 
successful, it is my firm belief that our customers will also need the right communications
in order to be successful.  We need to strive to be succinct, effective, and helpful in 
our customer communications so as to keep our support costs low and to increase their 
success.

### Innovation

I plan on striving for a deep understanding of our core platform domain including 
Unified Pipelines, compliance expectations, and container-native run-times.  As that 
understanding fills out

### Equality and Inclusion

Being new to the Mulesoft Deploy org, I look forward to encouraging a high level 
of equality by speaking less and listening more.  This also means being more patient 
with colleagues across timezones and geography in our remote work paradigm while
collaborating often in written form via decision records.
